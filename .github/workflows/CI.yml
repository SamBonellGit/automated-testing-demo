# ============================================================================
# CI (Continuous Integration) Workflow
# ============================================================================
# This workflow automatically runs tests and checks whenever code is pushed
# or a pull request is opened. CI helps catch bugs early by running automated
# checks on every code change.
# ============================================================================

# The name that appears in the GitHub Actions tab
name: CI

# ============================================================================
# TRIGGERS: When should this workflow run?
# ============================================================================
# The "on" section defines what events trigger this workflow.
on:
  # Run when code is pushed to the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Run when a pull request targets the "main" branch
  # This lets you check code BEFORE it gets merged
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# ============================================================================
# JOBS: What tasks should be performed?
# ============================================================================
# Jobs are the main units of work. Each job runs on a fresh virtual machine.
# You can have multiple jobs that run in parallel or sequentially.
jobs:
  # This job is named "test" - you can name jobs anything you want
  test:
    # Specifies the type of virtual machine to run on.
    # "ubuntu-latest" is a free Linux environment provided by GitHub.
    # Other options include: windows-latest, macos-latest
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # ========================================================================
    # STEPS: The individual tasks within this job
    # ========================================================================
    # Steps run sequentially, one after another.
    # If any step fails, the job stops (unless configured otherwise).
    steps:
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # This step downloads your repository's code onto the virtual machine.
      # Without this, the VM would be empty and have no code to work with!
      # "uses" means we're using a pre-built action from the GitHub marketplace.
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 2: Setup Node.js
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Installs Node.js on the virtual machine so we can run JavaScript/TypeScript.
      # "with" provides configuration options to the action.
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # The version of Node.js to install
          node-version: 20
          # Caches npm dependencies to speed up future runs
          cache: "npm"

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Installs all packages listed in package.json.
      # "npm ci" is preferred over "npm install" in CI because it's faster
      # and ensures exact versions from package-lock.json are used.
      # "run" executes a shell command directly.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 4: Lint the code
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Runs the linter to check for code style issues and potential errors.
      # Linting helps maintain consistent code quality across the project.
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 5: Run tests
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Executes the test suite to verify the code works as expected.
      # If any test fails, this step fails and the workflow stops.
      - name: Test
        run: npm test

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 6: Generate coverage report
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Runs tests with coverage tracking to see how much code is tested.
      # Coverage reports show which lines of code are executed during tests.
      - name: Coverage
        run: npm run coverage

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 7: Upload coverage as an artifact
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Artifacts are files saved from a workflow run that you can download later.
      # This uploads the coverage report so you can review it in the GitHub UI.
      - name: Upload coverage artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          # The name for this artifact (appears in the GitHub Actions UI)
          name: coverage
          # The folder/files to upload
          path: coverage

      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # Step 8: Placeholder for future test results
      # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
      # "if: always()" means this step runs even if previous steps failed.
      # This is useful for uploading test results regardless of pass/fail.
      - name: Upload test results (if you add junit later)
        if: always()
        run: echo "Optional, add junit output later"
